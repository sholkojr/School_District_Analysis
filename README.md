# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to summarize the results of a district wide test assessment of reading and math skills of students between grades 9 and 12.  The data was cleaned and summarized for an initial report.  

Subsequently, it was discovered that a portion of the data was invalid (grade 9 scores from Thomas High School) and the analysis was revised.  The following report summarizes the impact of the revised data from the initial submission.
