# School_District_Analysis

The data was cleaned and summarized for an initial report.  Subsequently, it was discovered that a portion of the data was invalid (grade 9 scores from Thomas High School) and the analysis was revised.  The following report summarizes the impact of the revised data from the initial submission.
